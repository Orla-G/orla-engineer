# Personal Website

<img src="/public/cover.jpg" alt="Cover image of my personal website" width="100%" />

This is my personal website built using Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Motion. As a mechanical engineer specializing in robotics and mechatronics, I've designed this site to showcase my projects, experience, and interests in a clean, minimalist manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **UI**: React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations**: Motion-Primitives
- **Component Library**: Lucide React for icons
- **Content**: MDX for blog posts
- **Theming**: next-themes for dark/light mode

## Based on the Nim Template

Nim is a free and open-source personal website template built with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Motion. Designed for developers, designers, and founders, it combines minimalism with delightful animated components powered by [Motion-Primitives](https://motion-primitives.com).

## Deployment

The site is deployed using Vercel which supports Next.js:

# Running the Dev Server Locally
 
## Prerequisites — Installing Node.js
 
`npm` (the package manager used here) comes bundled with Node.js automatically.
 
The recommended way to install Node on Linux is via **nvm** (Node Version Manager). It installs entirely in your home folder so it never needs `sudo`.
 
**1. Install nvm:**
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```
 
**2. Restart your terminal**, then verify nvm is available:
```bash
nvm --version
```
 
**3. Install the LTS version of Node (comes with npm):**
```bash
nvm install --lts
```
 
**4. Verify both installed correctly:**
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
 
> If you ever need to update Node later, just run `nvm install --lts` again.
 
---
 
## First-Time Setup
 
Only needed once after first pulling the repo:
 
```bash
# Move into the project folder (adjust path as needed)
cd path/to/your/project
 
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```
 
> This downloads everything the project needs into a `node_modules/` folder — it can take a minute.
> You never need to commit that folder, it's already in `.gitignore`.
 
---
 
## Starting the Dev Server
 
```bash
npm run dev
```
 
Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**
 
The dev server has **hot reload** — edits to files show up in the browser automatically without restarting.
 
To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
 
---
 
## After Pulling Updates in GitHub Desktop
 
If you pull new changes and something breaks or looks wrong, re-run:
 
```bash
npm install   # picks up any new/changed packages
npm run dev
```
 
---
 
## Other Useful Commands
 
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start local dev server at localhost:3000 |
| `npm run build` | Build the site for production |
| `npm run start` | Run the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Check for code style issues |
